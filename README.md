## Agile
This app was developed using Agile methodologies (Scrum, specifically) with the following User Stories in mind:

1. As a patient I want to log in so that I can see the patient screen.
2. As a patient I want to see a list of doctors and be able to filter through them so that I can find a doctor that meets my needs.
3. As a patient I want to be able to click on a doctor and see their availabilities so that I can book appointments and see my upcoming appointments updated accordingly.
4. As a doctor I want to log in so that I can see the doctors screen.
5. As a doctor I want to see my schedule for the week so that I can see when I have appointments.
6. As a doctor I want to be able to see patient details when I click on an upcoming appointment.
